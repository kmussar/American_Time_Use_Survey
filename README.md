Analysis of the American Time Use Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 

"The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) is the Nation’s first federally administered,
continuous survey on time use in the United States. The goal of the survey is to
measure how people divide their time among life’s activities.
In ATUS, individuals are randomly selected from a subset of households that have
completed their eighth and final month of interviews for the Current Population Survey
(CPS). ATUS respondents are interviewed only one time about how they spent their
time on the previous day, where they were, and whom they were with. The survey is
sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is conducted by the U.S. Census
Bureau.
The major purpose of ATUS is to develop nationally representative estimates of how
people spend their time. Many ATUS users are interested in the amount of time
Americans spend doing unpaid, nonmarket work, which could include unpaid childcare,
eldercare, housework, and volunteering. The survey also provides information on the
amount of time people spend in many other activities, such as religious activities,
socializing, exercising, and relaxing. In addition to collecting data about what people
did on the day before the interview, ATUS collects information about where and with
whom each activity occurred, and whether the activities were done for one’s job or
business. Demographic information—including sex, race, age, educational attainment,
occupation, income, marital status, and the presence of children in the household—also
is available for each respondent. Although some of these variables are updated during
the ATUS interview, most of this information comes from earlier CPS interviews, as the
ATUS sample is drawn from a subset of households that have completed month 8 of the
CPS."  -- Taken from the American Time Use Survey User's Guide
